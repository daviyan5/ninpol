        Number of elements
    n_points : int
        Number of points (vertices) that compose the mesh
    n_faces: int
        Number of faces that compose the mesh
    n_edges: int
        Number of edges that compose the mesh
    npoel : numpy.ndarray
        Number of points per element type

    element_types : numpy.ndarray
        Array containing the type of each element. The type of the i-th element is given by element_types[i].
        The description relating the geometry and the element type is given by the 'point_ordering.yaml' file.

    inpoel: numpy.ndarray
        Elements connectivity, passed by the user

    esup : numpy.ndarray
        Elements surrounding points connectivity
    esup_ptr : numpy.ndarray
        Elements surrounding points pointer. 
        i.e: The elements surrounding point i are in esup[esup_ptr[i]:esup_ptr[i+1]]

    fsup: numpy.ndarray
        Faces surrounding points
    fsup_ptr: numpy.ndarray
        Faces surrounding points pointer
        i.e : The faces surrounding point i are in fsup[fsup_ptr[i]:fsup_ptr[i+1]]

    psup : numpy.ndarray
        Points surrounding points connectivity
    psup_ptr : numpy.ndarray
        Points surrounding points pointer. 
        i.e: The points surrounding point i are in psup[psup_ptr[i]:psup_ptr[i+1]]

    nfael : numpy.ndarray
        Number of faces per element type
        i.e : The number of faces of a tetrahedron is nfael[4]

    lnofa : numpy.ndarray
        Number of points per face per element type

    inpofa: numpy.ndarray
        Points that compose each face
        i.e : The points that compose face i are in inpofa[i, :]
        OBS: Due to the way the faces are defined, the points will be ordered following the order of ONE of the elements that share the face.
        This means that lpofa should be used to get the correct order of the points.

    infael: numpy.ndarray
        Faces that compose each element
        i.e : The faces that compose element i are in infael[i, :])

        i.e : The elements surrounding element i are in esuel[i, :])
    
    nedel: numpy.ndarray
        Number of edges per element type
        i.e : The number of edges of element of type i is nedel[i]
    
    lpoed : numpy.ndarray
        Description of the edges of each element type
        i.e : The edges of an element of type i are in lpoed[i, :, :]

    inpoed: numpy.ndarray
        Points that compose each edge
        i.e : The points that compose edge i are in inpoed[i, :])
        OBS: Due to the way the edges are defined, the points will be ordered following the order of ONE of the elements that share the edge.
        This means that lpoed should be used to get the correct order of the points.

    inedel : numpy.ndarray
        Edges that compose each element
        i.e : The edges that compose element i are in edsuel[i, :])

        Builds the necessary grid data structures for the given connectivity matrix, that being:
            - Elements surrounding each point   (esup)
            - Points surrounding each point     (psup)
            - Number of faces                   (n_faces)
            - Elements surrounding each element (esuel)
            - ETC

        In the 3D case, the following data structures are also built:
            - Points that form each edge        (inpoed)
            - Edges that form each element      (ledel)
                
        Notes
        -----
        Assumes that the connectivity matrix is contiguous in memory, and that elements and points are 0-indexed in the mesh.
        If this parameter is not given, the element type will be inferred from the connectivity matrix.
            In this case, elements with 4 points will be considered as tetrahedrons
