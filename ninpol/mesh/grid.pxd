    """
        Builds the necessary grid data structures for the given connectivity matrix, that being:
            - Elements surrounding each point   (esup)
            - Points surrounding each point     (psup)
            - Number of faces                   (n_faces)
            - Elements surrounding each element (esuel)

        In the 3D case, the following data structures are also built:
            - Points that form each edge        (inpoed)
            - Edges that form each element      (ledel)

        Parameters
        ---------
            connectivity : np.ndarray
                Connectivity matrix. Each row contains the indices of the points that form an element.
                The connectivity matrix shall be a 2D array of shape (n_elems, 8), such that
                connectivity[i, :] contains the indices of the points that form the i-th element. 

                Reference on the ordering may be found at 'utils/point_ordering.yaml'

                THE COLUMNS WITH UNUSED POINTS SHALL BE FILLED WITH -1.
            element_types : np.ndarray
                Array containing the type of each element. The type of the i-th element is given by element_types[i].
                The description relating the geometry and the element type is given by the 'point_ordering.yaml' file.
                
        Notes
        -----
        Assumes that the connectivity matrix is contiguous in memory, and that elements and points are 0-indexed in the mesh.
        If this parameter is not given, the element type will be inferred from the connectivity matrix.
            In this case, elements with 4 points will be considered as tetrahedrons
